            <h2>Life at Covenant University</h2>
            <p>
                Covenant University is known for its discipline, spiritual atmosphere, and strong academic culture.
                From the early morning chapel services to late-night study sessions, the environment pushes you to
                develop yourself beyond academics.

            <h2>The No-Light Hours Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The 8am–6pm no-light schedule during weekdays forces students to plan wisely. Most people stay in
                classrooms, use the library, or work around campus power points. It’s stressful sometimes—but it also
                teaches time management.

            <h2>Community & Student Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Student communities like Google Developer Groups, school fellowships, and tech hubs make CU an exciting
                place. There’s always someone building something, reading something, or planning something.
